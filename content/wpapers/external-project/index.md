How do individual predispositions towards national politics influence public opinion formation on the European Union (EU)? This article addresses this question by advancing a novel argument on the dual moderating role of party politicisation of the EU. I argue that it can inform public opinion by creating an information-rich environment that fosters citizens to be less reliant on shortcuts and heuristics, such as their predispositions on the national economy and institutions. I also argue that it can guide public opinion by indicating to individuals how to activate identitarian predispositions. The empirical analysis focuses on 25 EU member states from 2002 to 2019. I run multilevel regressions with crosslevel interaction terms, relying on individual-level data from the European Social Survey, and country-year-level data from the Chapel Hill Expert Survey. The evidence suggests that citizens tend to rely less on short-term utilitarian appreciations of the national economy or trust in national institutions to form their view on the EU as the degree of party politicisation of the EU increases. The way citizens mobilise their predispositions towards other cultures and out-group members, such as immigrants, is not dependent on the level of party politicisation of the EU.
