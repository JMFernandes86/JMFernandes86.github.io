How do individual predispositions towards national politics influence public opinion formation on the EU? This article uses individual-level and country-year-level data from 25 EU members to test a novel argument on the dual moderating role of party politicisation of the EU. I argue that it can inform public opinion by creating an information-rich environment that fosters citizens to rely less on short-termutilitarian or institutional predispositions. I also argue that it can guide individuals by indicating how to activate identitarian predispositions. The evidence suggests that citizens tend to rely less on short-term utilitarian appreciations of the national economy or trust in national institutions to form their view on the EU as the degree of party politicisation of the EU increases. The way citizens mobilise their predispositions towards other cultures and out-group members, such as immigrants, is not dependent on the level of party politicisation of the EU.
